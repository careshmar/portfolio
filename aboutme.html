<p> Here are some pictures of my family and I. We love to celebrate holidays together! One of  my favorite holidays is christmas because
we open presents, eat good food, and most importantly watch christmas movies! Although, everyone is busy due to their daily routine and work, when we come together
we try to make it a memorable moment!</p>
