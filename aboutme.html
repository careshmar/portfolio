    <p> Hi,my name is Careshma as you can tell on my homepage! I like to watch movies, read books, and travel (even though I don't travel a lot) 
    My favorite genre of book that I like to read is psycological thrillers. If you are interested in this topic I would reccomend these books.
    I don't know what I want to do in the future but I am interested in Psychology. I was born on July 4th 2006!</p>
