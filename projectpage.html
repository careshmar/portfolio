<h2>Here are a list of my projects!</h2>
      
<li>Congressional App Challenge</li>
<br>
      
<p style="color:MidnightBlue;">Description: In this challege we had to create a project that would help solve an enduring issue or a problem that people face everyday. 
My group and I decided to base our app on fashion. We noticed that young adults struggle with what to wear everyday or can't find a style that fits them. 
"Style your way" was born and it is designed to help you find a style that matches you and we incorporated a really cool feature which allows the users to sreate their 
very own custom outfit!</p>
<br>      
      
<li>Emoji Project</li>
<p> Description:In this project we created three different emojis using shapes and we had to use coordinates to ensure that our emoji looks good! The emojis that I created are happy,
sad, and a simple emoji. I found it a little difficult at first to create these emotions because I felt that everyone was making the same shapes on their emojis. I 
decided to play around with the coordinates and made a unique moth for the sad emoji! In the end I think the emojis came out pretty well!</p>
      
<br>
    
<li>Animation Project</li>
<p> Description:In this project, we had to create a unique animation of our choice. I decided to create an animation that shows a target moving to the side and I added arrows to the
middle of the target to make it look more realistic. I also added some triangle and circle designs to the side of the target to make it more unique!</p>
